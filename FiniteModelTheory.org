* First order logic and SQL
  + Inexpressibility of first order logic to express 
   + transitivity
   + acyclicity
   + cardinality queries
  + Extensions to SQL like count -> Do they allow us to express acyclicity
  + What about other extensions like Fixed points?

* Complexity theory
  + Second order existential quantifier followed by first order formula
   + $âˆƒSO = NP$ .
   + The secord order existential quantifier express the guessing stage and the first order formula expresses the verification stage.
   + Fagin's theorem.

* Regular expressions and First order logic
  + First order logic cannot fully express every regular expression.
  + You need monadic second order logic to express every regular expression.

* Introduction to Mathematical Logic.
  + Vocabulary - Collection of constants, functions, relations.
   + Vocabulary is almost always atmost countable.
   + In finite model theory vocabulary is finite and relational (ie., only constants and relations no functions).
  + Structure is finite if the universe is finite.
  + Assume infinitely many variables, (countable)
  + Term is inductively defined.
   + Variable is a term.
   + Constant is a term.
   + $f_k(t_1, t_2 .. t_k)$ is a term if $f_k$ is a k-ary function and $t_1..t_k$ are terms.
  + Formula is inductively defined
   + $t_1 = t_2$ is atomic formula when $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms.
   + $p_k(t_1, t_2 .. t_k)$ is a formula if $p_k$ is a k-ary relation and $t_1..t_k$ are terms.
   + if $A$ and $B$ are formulae, then $A \wedge B$ , $A \vee B$ and $\neg A$ are formulae
    if $A$ is a formula then $\exists x A$ and $\forall x A$ is a formula.
  + Free variable of a formula is defined as
   + if x is a variable, only free variable is x itself.
   + constants dont have any free variable.
   + free variables in $t1 = t2$ are free variables in $t1$ union free variables in $t2$
   + free variables in $A \wedge B$ and $A \vee B$ is union of free variables in $A$ and free variables in $B$
   + free variables in $\neg A$ is exactly the free variables of $A$
   + free variables in $\exists x A$ and $\forall x A$ is free variables of $A$ with $x$ removed from it.
  + Completeness \imply Compactness
  + Validity is recursively enumerble if we consider arbitrary model
   + Its not recursively enumerable incase we consider only finite models.
  + Homomorphism, Isomorphism.
  + Lowenheim Skolem
   + Every theory with infinite model has a countable model.

* Computability
  + Regular Expressions = Languages recognized by NDFA = Languages recognized by DFA
  + Turing machine, deterministic/non deterministic
   + If there is a halting machine for a language, the machine is called decider and the language is called recursive.
   + Halting problem - Whether a machine M halts on input a is not recursive
   + Halting on empty input is also not decidable.
   + Any non trivial property of Turing machine is not decidable.

* Inexpressibility proofs.
** Connectivity of arbitrary graphs in not FO definable.
   + Consider sentence $C$ define the connectivity
   + For every n let $P_n$ defines a statement which establishes there is no path of length $n$.
   + Now consider the infinite set $\{C\} \cup \{P_0 ... \}$ this set is obviously inconsistent.
   + But every finite subset of it is consistent.
   + Only contradiction could be that $C$ is not definable in first place.
   + Hence connectivity is not FO definable.
** Compactness fails over finite models
   + If we take finite graphs is connectivity definable?
   + Is this true? theory $T$ has a finite model if every finite subset of of $T$ has finite model? (No.)
   + Let $P_n$ define a statement which says there are *atleast* n elements.
   + Obviously $\{P_0, P_1... \}$ has no finite model but every finite subset of it do.
** Even cardinality is not FO definable
   + Even cardinality makes sense only in finite models
   + Suppose E is a statement which defines the fact that there are even number of elements.
   + Suppose P_i is defined as above.
   + Now by compactness $\{E\} \cup \{P_0, P_1...\}$  and $\{ \neg E \} \cup \{P_0, P_1 ... \}$ are consistent.
   + Assume the theory doesn't have any other vocabulary (no constant, no relations)
   + They are just countable sets, hence they are isomorphic, but in one of them E is true, and other E is false.
   + Hence contradiction.
** For every finite structure $A$ there is a sentence $S$ such that $B \models S \iff B \cong A$
   + A and B are isomorphic iff they agree on every Boolean query.
   + Boolean queries are closed under isomorphism.

* Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games.
** Game steps
  + Two players, spoiler vs duplicator.
  + Spoiler picks the structure $A$ or $B$
  + Spoiler makes a move by picking an element $a \in A$ or $a \in B$.
  + Duplicator responds by picking an element from the other structure.
  + Duplicator has a n-step winning strategy if after n-steps he could establish partial isomorphism no matter how spoiler plays.
** Partial isomorphism
    + Let $A$ and $B$ be two $\sigma$-structures. ($\sigma$ is a vocabulary)
    + tuples $(a_1,...,a_n)$ and $(b_1,..,b_n)$ are partially isomorphic if
      + for every $i,j \leq n$ $a_i = a_j \iff b_i = b_j$
      + for every constant $c$ from $\sigma$ and $i \leq n$ $a_i = c_A \iff b_i = c_B$
      + for every k-ary relation $P$,  $(a_{i_1},..,a_{i_k}) \in P^A \iff  (b_{i_1},..,b_{i_k}) \in P^B$
** Game on linear order
  + Suppose $\sigma$ contains the binary relation $<$ interpreted as a linear order.
  + If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are linear orders of size atleast $m$ and $m \geq n$, is $L_1 {\cong}_n L_2$
  + Consider the sets $\{1,2\}$ and ${1,2,3}$. Now if the spoiler plays $2$ duplicator has to play either $1$ or $2$ and the next move spoiler wins the game.
  + But if $n$ is much smaller than sizes of linear order the game can be won by duplicator.
  + If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are linear orders of length atleast $2^k$ then $L_1 {\cong}_k L_2$.
    + Its sort of like binary search to find a flaw here, the proof can be worked out in detail though.
  + Suppose $L_1^{\geq a}$ be a substructure of all elements $x$, $x \geq a$ and similarly $L_1^{\leq a}$.
    + If $L_1^{\leq a} \cong_k L_2^{\leq b}$ and $L_1^{geq a} \cong_k L_2^{\geq b}$ then $(L_1, a) \cong_k (L_2, b)$.
    + This could be used under induction to prove the previous game.

* Games and expressive power of FO
** Quantifier rank
   + The quantifier rank of a formula is the depth of the quantifier nesting, ie.,
     + If $\phi$ is atomic then $qr(\phi) = 0$
     + $qr(A \vee B) = qr(A \wedge B) = max(qr(A), qr(B))$
     + $qr(\neg A) = qr(A)$
     + $qr(\exists x A) = qr(\forall x A) = qr(A) + 1$
   + $FO[k]$ is used to represent all the first-order formulae of quantifier rank k.
** Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse theorem
   + Let $A$ and $B$ are relational structures, then the following are equivalent
     + $A$ and $B$ agree on $FO[k]$
     + $A \equiv_k B$ 
   + A property $P$ of finite $\sigma$-structure is not expressible in FO if for every $k \in N$ if there are two structures $A$ and $B$ such that,
     + $A \equiv_k B$
     + $A$ has the property while $B$ doesn't.
   + Even is not FO definable (Take two structure of size $\geq 2^k$ one even and one odd, $FO[k]$ cannot distinguish them, with or without linear order).
** Rank k types
   + If $\sigma$ is finite, then there are only finitely many $FO[k]$ for each $k$ with m free variables.
     + If you consider each atomic formula with m-free variable as propositions, then there are finately many boolean combinations of them (How many boolean functions are there from $p$ boolean variables?)
     + If there are only finitely many $FO[k]$ formulae  with $m+1$ free variables, then there are finitely many $FO[k+1]$ formulae with $m$ free variables.
   + Fix a relational vocabulary $\sigma$ if $A$ is a $sigma$-structure then, the rank-k m-type is consistent set of $FO[k]$ formulae with $m$ free variables.
     + Every rank-k types are maximally consistent set of $FO[k]$ formulae, if $\phi(x_1, .. x_m) \in FO[k]$ then either $\phi$ or $\neg \phi$ is in rank-k type.
   + Since $FO[k]$ is finite upto equivalence, for given $m$ then every rank-k m-structure can be expressed as a conjunction of all $FO[k]$ true formulae.
   + The equivalence relation $\equiv_k$ is of finite index.
